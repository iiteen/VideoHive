# Simple Version Control System

This project is a simple version control system, inspired by Git. It provides basic functionality for managing and collaborating on code repositories.

## Features

- **Initialize a repository:** Create a new repository to start tracking your code.
- **Create branches:** Create new branches to work on different features or bug fixes in parallel.
- **Checkout branches:** Switch between branches to work on different parts of the codebase.
- **Delete branches:** Delete branches that are no longer needed.
- **Fast-forward merge:** Merge changes from one branch into another using a fast-forward merge, if possible.
- **Three-way merge:** Merge changes from two branches using a three-way merge, if a fast-forward merge is not possible.
- **Stashing:** Temporarily save changes that are not ready to be committed, and restore them later.
- **Staging area:** Stage changes before committing them, to review and organize your changes.
